Hello summoners!
I am a wizard from ancient and historic Prague! Currently studying Master's degree in Financial Engineering. I would like to deepen my knowledge in data science, therefore I started to study courses on Data Science, Statistics and Mathematics in order to have a better understanding in these areas.
Thank you for your time.
